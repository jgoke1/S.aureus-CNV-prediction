# S.aureus-CNV-prediction
Identifying borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus via CNV prediction using Contol-FREEC

Staphylococcus aureus is a major global pathogen, with methicillin resistance posing significant challenges. Borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA) are mecA-negative, yet methicillin-resistant and often misclassified as methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Suggestions that the BORSA phenotype may arise from elevated expression levels of blaZ gene, as reported by many studies.

This study aims to develop and validate whole-genome sequence-based methods to identify BORSA, using copy number variation of the blaZ gene.

We used the Control-freec4 algorithm for the detection of copy number in 145 known methicilin resistant lacking mec (MRLM) and 166 known MSSA, all with known mic values from studies1,2,3. As well in comparison to mutations of the MRLM in the gdpP and PBPs genes.
